    title:          Opinion on Createx

                    I did a quick search and saw that createx isn't tremendously highly recommended.
                    However, I can get it extremely cheap and therefore would like to use it if I can. Either the regular, wicked, or auto-air.
                    In searching I saw someone who said regular createx doesn't stick well, would using their illustration base help that?

    title:          The MVC application

                    A Play! application follows the MVC architectural pattern as applied to the
                    architecture of the Web.

                    This pattern splits the application into separate layers: the Presentation
                    layer and the Model layer. The Presentation layer is further split into a
                    View and a Controller layer.
